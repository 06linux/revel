Revel provides a couple samples to demonstrate typical usage.

* [Booking](booking.html) - A database-driven hotel-booking application,
  including user management.
* [Chat](chat.html) - A chat room demonstrating active refresh, long-polling
  (comet), and websocket implementations.

The samples can generally be run easily, for example:

	$ revel run github.com/robfig/revel/samples/chat
